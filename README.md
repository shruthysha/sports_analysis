## Cricket Player Performance Analysis for T20 Games
### How the Code Works:
#### 1. Data Retrieval and Preprocessing:
* The code retrieves player data from ESPN's cricket database in JSON format.
* It preprocesses the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Utilizes statistical functions and visualizations to explore player attributes and performance metrics.
* Analyzes trends and patterns in player data to gain insights into player performance.
#### 3. Performance Analysis:
* Applies advanced data analysis techniques to compare player performances across different conditions.
* May involve machine learning models from Scikit-learn or statistical models from StatsModels.
* Specialized libraries for time series analysis might be used for in-depth performance assessment.
#### 4. Findings and Recommendations:
* Presents detailed statistical insights into player performance through data visualization.
* Utilizes Git for version control and GitHub for repository hosting to ensure code maintainability, portability, and public accessibility.

### Running the Code:
* The code can be run on Google Colab or locally on Jupyter Notebook.
* Follow the installation instructions provided in the README to set up the environment.
* Execute the code cells sequentially to retrieve, preprocess and analyze the data.
