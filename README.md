Cricket Player Performance Analysis for T20 Games
Business Requirements with Technical Stack:
Objective:
Evaluate the fitness and performance of cricket players for a T20 game by analyzing current form and historical performance.

Data Source:
ESPN's extensive cricket database, with player information provided in JSON format.

Technical Stack:
Python as the primary programming language, with the potential use of libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical data processing, and JSON for parsing data in JSON format. The project likely involves a development environment that supports Python code, such as Jupyter Notebooks or a Python IDE.

Approaches with Methods and Libraries:
Data Preprocessing:
Use of Python libraries to import data from Excel files, handle missing or inconsistent data, and parse JSON formatted data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Application of statistical functions and visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn to explore player attributes and performance metrics.

Performance Analysis:
Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques to compare player performances across different conditions. This might involve the use of Scikit-learn for any machine learning models, StatsModels for statistical models, or specialized libraries for time series analysis.

Findings and Recommendations with Technical Aspects:
Findings:
Detailed statistical insights into player performance, leveraging Python's data visualization libraries to present data-driven insights effectively. The use of Git for version control and GitHub for repository hosting would ensure that the codebase is maintainable, portable, and publicly accessible as per the project's guidelines.

Recommendations:
Data-informed strategies for team composition and training, which could be based on predictive modeling and simulations using Python's comprehensive analytical libraries.
